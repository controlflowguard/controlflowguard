### 🚀 About Me

I'm a fullstack developer who builds tools, platforms, and protection systems from the ground up. I specialize in high-performance Lua and JavaScript tooling, but I move seamlessly between backend, frontend, game scripting, and system-level logic.

Over the past few years, I’ve created stealth UIs, anti-exploit frameworks, remote analysis tools, Discord integrations, and Roblox game mechanics optimized for both performance and security.

Whether I’m engineering backend APIs, deploying frontend interfaces, or reverse engineering exploits, I focus on performance, polish, and precision.
